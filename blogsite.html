        What comes to your mind when you think of Sundarbans? Herds of wild animals, flocks of birds, vast spread across lands and water bodies filled with wilderness? That's not all. There is no better place than the Sundarbans if you want to enjoy nature by sitting on the deck of the ship, watching crocodiles sunbathing by the side of the river channels that are spread across the large mangrove forest like spider webs. 
        The best time to visit the Sundarbans is winter, especially from November to March. It’s best to plan and book a tour at least 15 days prior to the journey because one has to take permits from the forest department at least 7 days prior to the tour. One of the leading online travel platforms Go Zayaan is working relentlessly to make these tours available for all types of travellers. Currently, Go Zayaan has introduced three such tours to cater to the demands of travellers of all types! This is 4 days 3 nights and the only tour where the journey starts from Dhaka. The tour will have mouth-watering food for all 4 days with A/C cabins, attached washroom, hot water facility, forest fees and permit for local guests, local boat for an exploration of flora and fauna, two armed guards on board at all times and much more. 

        Price starts from BDT 15,000 per person.  <small>see more</small>
